# k-means-openmp-parallel

Parallel implementation of k-means clustering algorithm in C using OpenMP API. Three different approaching have been developed in order to discover which one could bring to better performances.

## notes
Several testings are provided and documented in report and google cloud runnings of the algorithms have been made to test scalability.
